# Interview Scheduler (Redux)

## Intro

A React App that allows a user to book, cancel, and peruse interviews. This simple application allows users to cycle through a set of days to seek out the appropriate interview time slot to book—or if need be—delete an unneeded appointment.

This is a front-end only app designed to illustrate the single page capabilities of the React framework, as well as sufficient understanding of api calls.

This app requires the companion [api server](https://github.com/vanlgo/scheduler-api).
